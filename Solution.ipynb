    "\n",
    "__Initial Thoughts__\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the representation of each city is relatively simple. Each city only requires a set of location coordinates (x,y) which are contained within the class, `City`, and assigned during instantiation of a new `City` object. The location coordinates should also be non-mutable as no change would sensibly be necessary. The more pressing concern is generating the distance between every other city in the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Calculating Distances__\n",
    "\n",
    "While it would be interesting to attempt the computation during the intial creation of the list, this approach would not be feasible because the addition of new cities would require a separate record of computations introducing the possibility of incomplete distance data. Instead, each `City` object can compute its distance from every other city after all cities have been instantiated. This approach is best suited as a method of the `City` class and would require the complete list of cities in the problem space.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also assumed that there are no objects, except other cities, blocking the most direct route from one city to another. For this reason, the pythagorean theorem is used to calculate the shortest path (straight line) between two cities. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Additional Considerations__ \n",
    "\n",
    "With the required attributes and methods defined, it's easy to see there's still a glaring lack of organization â€“ more specifically, identification. While iterating over a list of non-identifiable `City` objects would work, it's not very readable. There's also performance implications of using a list (i.e. O(n) search). To fix this, each city object will be given an unique alphanumeric identifier. This minor change allows the use of the time-efficient dictionary data structure to store and access each `City` object. The same reasoning extends to storing the distance from a city to all other cities; this data will stored inside each `City` object as an attribute. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, making public data within an object accesible with as little external computation as possible is one of the standards in OOP. Various \"getters and setters\" will be used to satisfy this standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Notes_:\n",
    "\n",
    "- As required by the assignment, test runs should be completed with at least 25 different locations generated at random. \n",
    "- Creating a reusable function that generates and returns a list of random locations based on a given seed ensures randomness and reproducibility. \n",
    "- The distance between two cities is rounded 3 decimal points to ensure conversion to whole integers in later computations. Floating point errors suck.\n"

    "The TSP focuses on optimization and ordering of elements which means the preferred choice of encoding is _order encoding_.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Wait A Second...__\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that a value of -1 was attached to all `City` objects during the `generate_random_cities` function; this is because the the data that would be stored in a separate order-encoded data structure is the exact same as the data used everywhere else to access each city. Instead of duplicating this data, it made sense to attach the ordering to the city id as well. This may lead you to believe the encoding of the solution can be considered hybrid with elements of both _order_ and _real-value encoding_; not exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the encoding to be considered _real-value_, the real values stored must actively be examined as a factor for determining the fitness(more on this later) or viability of the solution. While the real values, the city identifier and reference to the object in this case, are a handy utility during the computation process, they are not a factor that affect the actual computations. For this reason, this implementation should only be considered _order encoded_.\n",

    "\n",
    "It's important to discuss how the fitness of an individual is determined before moving forward; after all, this attribute will be the major factor in the rest of the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Disqualifying Factors__\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we already know that each city must be visited exactly once from the problem description. Therefore, any solution that does not have a non-negative order for every city in plane should be penalized in such a way to minimize the chance reproduction; in this case, we'll set the fitness score of the solution to 0 (more on this later). \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we know that an ordering scheme requires _unique, contiguous_ symbols to represent the sequence in which all actions should take place. This property implies that a valid solution will only contain cities with a unique order number ranging from the a non-negative(0) to N-1 in this implementation. Any solution that violates this property should also be categorizes as unfit for reproduction(fitness score = 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Ranking Factors__\n",
    "\n",
    "With those two disqualifying conditions set, there's only one factor remaining to determine the fitness score of a solution : the total distance of the path. Since the optimal solution should be the solution with the least total distance travelled, solutions with smaller total travel distances should receive better scores than solutions with larger total travel distances. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Additional Considerations__\n",
    "\n",
    "In an effort to minimize floating point and other arithmetic errors, the fitness score function will always return a non-negative integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've taken the liberty of defining some utilities here as well in the DRY spirit.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Notes_:\n",
    "- \"Individual\" and \"solution\" can be used interchangeably here. \"Solution\" made more sense to use within the context of the explanation.\n",
    "    - Also, since we can start thinking of solutions as individuals from this point forward and typing out `dict[str, list[City, int]]` is tiring, we'll define a pretty handy alias `Individual` here.\n",
    "- The term \"better\" is also used loosely here. In the context of this implementation, a \"better\" fitness score could be one that is lower than another. For the sake of simplicity (and my brain), solutions resulting in lower travel distances will receive a higher fitness score.\n",
    "    - In order to implement this properly, a small amount of reasoning is required:\n",
    "        1. The worst possible solution has a path where every edge is between two cities exactly PLANE_DIMENSION_X, PLANE_DIMENSION_Y (maximum plane size) units away from each other. These solutions will have a maximum total distance of `Number of cities + 1 (final city -> origin city) * âˆš (PLANE_DIMENSION_X^2 + PLANE_DIMENSION_Y^2)`. \n",
    "        2. Direct distances are rounded to the nearest thousandth, so multiplying by 1,000 will remove any decimal values. \n",
    "   - Therefore, to ensure lower distances receive higher scores and fitness scores are non-negative whole integers, the total distance will be used within a subtract operation a value roughly 100,000 times more than the maximum total distance. "

    "### Selecting Parents\n",
    "\n",
    "The best choices of parent selection in this implentation are _rank_ and _tournament selection_. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Explanation__\n",
    "\n",
    "The major reason for this is simplicity. _Roulette-wheel selection_ involves using an individual's fitness score in some division-focused expression to determine the individual's likeliness of being selection for reproduction. This reintroduces the possibility of floating point and other arithmetic errors back into the solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Rank_ and _tournament selection_ do not have this drawback, though they do decrease the chance of diversity among the population. Along the same train of thought, _elitism selection_ leaves much to be desired and doesn't provide any significant benefit over the other methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Final Decision__\n",
    "\n",
    "To create as diverse a population as possible within the context of the implementation, _rank selection_ will be used as the primary selection method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from electing a selection method, there's the question of where it should be implemented â€“ and the answer is also straightforward. The selection method will require access to all of the data stored within a `Population` object, therefore, it is implemented as a method within the `Population` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Notes_:\n",
    "- Though _rank selection_ is the primary selection method used, _tournament_ , _elitism_ , and _roulette-wheel selection_ have been implemented (as time allows) for testing and comparison purposes.\n",

    "__Crossover Methods__\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a look back at the section answering `Question 2`, it's easy to draw the conclusion that all crossover methods will be detrimental to finding the optimal solution. In general, _order encoded_ problems are ill-suited for crossover methods, however, the TSP takes this to a new level by placing a restriction on the solution that effectively disqualifies most children created using _one-point_, _two-point_, or _uniform crossover_ : \"All cities, except the origin city, must be visited exactly once.\" Because of this, crossover methods will not be used as primary reproduction methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Mutation Methods__\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to crossover methods, most children created using _bounded_ or _arithmetic mutation_ will be disqualified. The one exception and selected primary method of reproduction is _order mutation_. _Order mutation_ already takes the unique ordering requirement into account and is the clear choice for this implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Addtional Considerations__\n",
    "Unlike the process of selecting parents, the process of creating children can be implemented outside of the `Population` class as it doesn't require access to the data contained in the object. In fact, most of the methods only require access to one or two indidividuals which can be passed as parameters to a general, class-independent utility function. Nevertheless, these functions will still be included as utility functions in the `Population` class as they will undoubtedly be used exlcusively for manipulation of a `Population` object. \n",

    "- Though order mutation is the primary reproduction method used, the crossover and other mutation methods may be implemented for testing and comparison purposes as time allows.\n",

For this reason, I've __*attempted*__ to implement all of the various methods that a genetic algorithm can use to determine the optimal solution. By testing all of the different decision-making methods and (hopefully) ending up with the same solution, it's significantly more likely that the given solution is the best possible one."

    "It looks like this relatively \"small\" test was useful for benchmarking. Here, we can clearly see that the fitness threshold stopping condition will either make the algorithm or break it. This observation alludes back to the sections describing the repopulation method and stopping condition.\n",

    "Lastly, any functionality not already implemented is most likely not going to be â€“ and there are some good reasons for that. One, the functionality in question is not a good fit for the problem space and will only increase code complexity. Two â€“ and this is very important â€“ is because I don't want to Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯.\n",

    "In all seriousness, I've accomplished my goal to learn as much about the genetic algorithm as possible through practical application and the project goals described in the opening section. Could the application be more efficient? Of course. Are there places where the code can be refactored? Probably. Nevertheless, I believe the original goals of the project have been met and that makes this as good a stopping point as any.\n",

    "- An extra constraint was added to the genetic algorithm for runs with the fitness threshold stopping condition to prevent the algorithm from running for ridiculously long times. Without this constraint the algorithm has run for a record of at least 10 hours for one configuration.\n"
