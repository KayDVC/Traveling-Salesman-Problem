## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to design and implement a solution to the [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) using a genetic algorithm.

This repo contains a jupyter notebook file showing complete implementation, sample runs, and additional tests.

In addition to the implementation, each design choice is explained and well documented in the context of the problem.

Thanks,
